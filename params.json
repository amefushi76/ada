You must have clients/client0/client_config.inc.php and clients/client1/client_config.inc.php.\r\n    in client1/client_config.inc.php the constant name must be CLIENT1_DB_NAME, CLIENT1_DB_USER, CLIENT1_DB_PASS, CLIENT1_DB_HOST, CLIENT1_TIMEZONE\r\n\r\n13. change the permission of the directory services/media/ the web server must be able to write in it\r\n\r\n14. change the permission of the directory upload_file/ the web server must be able to write in it\r\n\r\n15. change the permission of the directory docs/ the web server must be able to write in it\r\n\r\n16. change the informations of the news editing the file: browsing/news_language (ex.: news_en is the news in english) \r\n    or using edit_news.php after logon as admin\r\n\r\n17. configure the widgets loaded in home page\r\n    copy widgets/main/index_DEFAULT.XML in widgets/main/index.xml\r\n    see widgets/main/index.xml in order to know how to configure\r\n\r\n\r\nCUSTOMIZE THE LAYOUT\r\n--------------\r\ncustomize the layout in the directory templates and css.\r\n\r\n**The file layout/layout_family/header.tpl contains the header of all pages. \r\nYou can change the logo and the header modifying the file layout/layout_family/header.tpl**\r\n\r\nThe structure of the directories that contain the layout is:\r\n- layout/layout_family/css/module_name\r\n- layout/layout_family/templates/module_name\r\n- layout/layout_family/img/\r\n\r\n- js\r\n\t/module_name/\r\n\r\nLOCALIZATION AND LANGUAGES\r\n--------------\r\nAt the moment ADA is translated in the following languages:\r\n- english\r\n- italian\r\n- spanish\r\n\r\nEach translation is stored in a table contained in the DB common.\r\nthe name of the table is messaggi_language (ex.: english messaggi_en)\r\n\r\n### Translation of messages and GUI ###\r\n  The system translates at real time all the interface (buttons, links, labels) and all the messages that are to be sent to the user (welcome message excluded, see below).\r\n  After logging into ADA as Switcher or Admin, go to this address:\r\n  http://your_domain_of_wisp/switcher/translation.php\r\n\r\n  You'll see a small form to search the sentences or part of them.\r\n  * Write in this form the sentence you want to translate (or modify)\r\n  * The system will show a list of the sentences similar to the one you wrote in the form, if any.\r\n  * click on modify in the line in which you can read the sentence you wish to translate.\r\n  * replace the missing or wrong sentence with the correct one\r\n  * click on \"update\"\r\n  * Go back\r\n\r\n### Note and suggestions. ###\r\n  In order to have the experience of ADA use and to check the correct translation in context,\r\n  we suggest you to open two different web browsers (NOT two windows of the same browser),\r\n  say A. Firefox\r\n  and B. Google Chrome.\r\n\r\n  - In browser \"A\" you can login as user or pratitioner or switcher and use the ADA platform normally.\r\n  - In browser \"B\" you have to login as switcher and go to the translation module\r\n  - When, navigating in browser \"A\", you may find a sentence not translated in your language, or with a wrong translation,\r\n  - in browser \"B\" you can search for that sentence and change its translation\r\n  Note that after the translation of each sentence you have to reload the page in the browser \"A\" in order to see the newly translated sentence\r\n\r\n### How to add a language. ###\r\n  - You have to add a record to the table \"lingue\" (which means language in italian) contained in the db common using a tool like phpmyadmin.\r\n    ex.: to add french language you have to add a record like this id: 7, name language: français, code: fr, table identifier: fr,\r\n  - You can copy the table messaggi_en contained in the db common to messaggi_language using a tool like phpmyadmin (ex.: french messaggi_fr).\r\n  - you can use the translation module (see Translation of messagges and GUI section above)\r\n    or in alternative you can export the content of the table, translate all and reimport the table using a tool like phpmyadmin.\r\n\r\nEXTRA CONFIGURATION\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n### Welcome message mail ###\r\n  You can change the text of the welcome message sended to the user just registered:\r\n  /docs/welcome_language.txt (ex.: /docs/welcome_en.txt english message)\r\n\r\n### Help ###\r\n  the directory docs contains also the help for the user. You can change the help by editing each single file.\r\n\r\n### Public course ###\r\nYou can set **one public course for provider 0** (in case MULTIPROVIDER is set to true, otherwise each provider has his own public course defined in clientX.inc.php by the value of the constant PUBLIC_COURSE_ID_FOR_NEWS).   \r\n**The default public id course of provider 0 is definied in config/config_install.inc.php by the value of the constant PUBLIC_COURSE_ID_FOR_NEWS**\r\n\r\nSYSTEM SETUP\r\n-------------\r\n1. **change the news in home page**.\r\n   You can change the news from inside the platform, logging in with administer user and clicking the voice \"edit news\" in act (or do) menù\r\n   You can also modify it, changing the files docs/news/news_language.txt (es.: english news_en.txt)\r\n   You can open it and change using any text editor. It is possibile to use HTML tag.\r\n\r\n2. **Create the users of type switcher (coordinator) and Tutors.**\r\n   How to do:\r\n   - log on with the platform Admin,\r\n   - click on Do menù,\r\n   - click on add user,\r\n   - choose the provider to which associate the user.\r\n\r\n3. **Arrangement of courses provided**\r\n\r\n   How the ADA platform works\r\n   + In the ADA platform are defined the courses delivered (they are saved in DB common)\r\n   + Each provider creates their own courses (they are saved in DB indicated in the clientX/client_conf.inc.php)\r\n   + Each course created by the provider is (automatically) linked to the platform courses (saved in DB common).\r\n   + Each provider has to create at least one instance of the course (the classroom) in order to allow the students to subscribe the instance\r\n\r\n   How to do:\r\n   + log on with the switcher account,\r\n   + click on Do menù,\r\n   + click on add a course\r\n   + click on add instance, near the course\r\n\r\n### Notes ###\r\n   Users have to register in the platform in order to participate the courses. (the users that have registered in ADA receive an email to confirm the registration)\r\n\r\nAdd one provider\r\n--------------\r\nto add a provider, you need to do the following tasks:\r\n- create a new DB\r\n- import the sql ada_provider_empty.sql into the new DB\r\n- follow the steps 11 and 12 \r\n- login as admin \r\n- create a new provider (from menù actions)\r\n  take care to write in the field \"Puntatore al database\" the same name of the directory contained in clients (ex.: client1)\r\n- create the new coordinator user for the provider just created\r\n\r\npredefined USERS are:\r\n--------------\r\n- adminAda --> Super Admin\r\n- autoreAda0 --> author of first provider\r\n- tutorAda0 --> tutor of first provider \r\n- switcherAda0 --> Admin of first provider\r\n- studenteAda0 --> Student of first provider\r\n\r\npasswords are the same of the username\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
